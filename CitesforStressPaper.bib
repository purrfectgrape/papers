	Abstract = {Whether native speakers of non-tonal languages can acquire categorical representations of lexical tones remains controversial. This study investigates the acquisition of lexical tone categories by native English speakers learning Mandarin Chinese as a foreign language by comparing the categorical perception (CP) of lexical tones between three groups of listeners: (1) native English speakers who had taken advanced Mandarin courses in colleges; (2) native English speakers with no knowledge of Mandarin Chinese; and (3) native Mandarin speakers. Two tonal continua derived from natural speech within carrier phrases were created through interpolation within two tonal contrasts (tone 1/tone 4, T1/T4; tone 2/tone 3, T2/T3). Results showed categorical-like perception of tones by native Mandarin speakers. The inexperienced English speakers performed near chance on discrimination tasks and showed significantly broader identification boundaries than the other two groups. The learners of Mandarin showed similar pattern of CP to native Mandarin speakers, but with higher overall discrimination scores. Findings suggest that CP of lexical tone may be available to advanced second language learners. {\copyright} 2016 Acoustical Society of America.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: This study investigated how listeners' native language affects their weighting of acoustic cues (such as vowel quality, pitch, duration, and intensity) in the perception of contrastive word stress. Method: Native speakers (N = 45) of typologically diverse languages (English, Russian, and Mandarin) performed a stress identification task on nonce disyllabic words with fully crossed combinations of each of the 4 cues in both syllables. Results: The results revealed that although the vowel quality cue was the strongest cue for all groups of listeners, pitch was the second strongest cue for the English and the Mandarin listeners but was virtually disregarded by the Russian listeners. Duration and intensity cues were used by the Russian listeners to a significantly greater extent compared with the English and Mandarin participants. Compared with when cues were noncontrastive across syllables, cues were stronger when they were in the iambic contour than when they were in the trochaic contour. Conclusions: Although both English and Russian are stress languages and Mandarin is a tonal language, stress perception performance of the Mandarin listeners but not of the Russian listeners is more similar to that of the native English listeners, both in terms of weighting of the acoustic cues and the cues' relative strength in different word positions. The findings suggest that tuning of second-language prosodic perceptions is not entirely predictable by prosodic similarities across languages. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

	Abstract = {
Although intensity has been reported as a reliable acoustical correlate of stress, it is generally considered a weak cue in the perception of linguistic stress. In natural speech stressed syllables are produced with more vocal effort. It is known that, if a speaker produces more vocal effort, higher frequencies increase more than lower frequencies. In this study, the effects of lexical stress on intensity are examined in the abstraction from the confounding accent variation. A production study was carried out in which ten speakers produced Dutch lexical and reiterant disyllabic minimal stress pairs spoken with and without an accent in a fixed carrier sentence. Duration, overall intensity, formant frequencies, and spectral levels in four contiguous frequency bands were measured. Results revealed that intensity differences as a function of stress are mainly located above 0.5 kHz, i.e., a change in spectral balance emphasizing higher frequencies for stressed vowels. Furthermore, we showed that the intensity differences in the higher regions are caused by an increase in physiological effort rather than by shifting formant frequencies due to stress. The potential of each acoustic correlate of stress to differentiate between initial- and final-stressed words was examined by linear discriminant analysis. Duration proved the most reliable correlate of stress. Overall intensity and vowel quality are the poorest cues. Spectral balance, however, turned out to be a reliable cue, close in strength to duration.},

	Abstract = {Twenty‐five English noun‐verb pairs, differing principally in their stress patterns, were recorded by 16 native speakers of American English. The fundamental frequency, relative amplitude, duration, and integral of the amplitude with respect to time of the stressed and unstressed syllables were measured and related to the aurally perceptible stress patterns. The relative value of these factors as cues to such patterns varied with different speakers, but it was found that certain ``trading effects'' offset a lack of differentiation in one acoustic dimension by changes, coherent with the perceptual stress pattern, in another dimension. A simple binary automatic stress recognition program, based on the redundancies inherent in the acoustic correlates and trading effects, was then devised. The stress judgments made with this program agreed with the perceived patterns 99.2%},

	Abstract = {The experiment reported in this paper investigated tonal transfer in Vietnamese perception of English stress. 95 Vietnamese subjects including 17 advanced Vietnamese speakers of English and 80 beginning learners of English from four regional dialects (Hanoi, Saigon, Hue and Nghe An, 20 speakers of each dialect) participated in a perception test. The subjects listened to English words and marked each syllable with the nearest Vietnamese tone that they perceived. The results indicated that an English syllable could be perceived as a certain Vietnamese tone depending on the syllable structure (a closed syllable ending in an obstruent or a syllable ending in a sonorant) and stress levels (stressed and unstressed). Regional dialectal differences in the expression of tonal contrasts also affected subjects' performance on the tone identification task. It is argued that the results of the experiment support a stress to L1 tonal transfer strategy in Vietnamese learners' initial adaptations to English stress and accent patterns.
